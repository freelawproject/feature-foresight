# Foresight

Historically, we have created issues in CourtListener whenever we were considering new features. 
That's fine, but it mixes up features with work and does not encourage feature design and 
discussion. 

The aim of this repository is to generate discussion so that we can have a prioritized roadmap of features that are well-scoped, defined, and prioritized.

How it works:
 - Prioritization can be seen on [the roadmap kanban](https://github.com/orgs/freelawproject/projects/59/views/1)

 - If you are a member of the public, you can make suggestions via a new [Idea Discussion](https://github.com/freelawproject/feature-foresight/discussions/categories/ideas). Those ideas may be added to the roadmap in the future.

 - If you are an FLP staff member with a well-defined idea, use [this template][t] to add an issue to this repo. If you do not have enough information to fill in the template, we encourage you to share the feature in the Ideas Discussion.
