# Feature Foresight

Historically, we have created issues in CourtListener whenever we were considering new features. 
That's fine, but it mixes up features with work and does not encourage feature design and 
discussion. 

The aim of this repository is to create a sandbox where we can create a prioritized roadmap of
features that are well-scoped, defined, and then prioritized.

To create a new feature, file an issue. We will be creating a template for this in the near 
future, so you can be sure to mention everything we need.

Feature prioritization takes place on a [Github Project board][p].
