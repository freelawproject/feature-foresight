# Foresight

Historically, we have created issues in CourtListener whenever we were considering new features. 
That's fine, but it mixes up features with work and does not encourage feature design and 
discussion. 

The aim of this repository is to create a sandbox where we can create a prioritized roadmap of
features that are well-scoped, defined, and then prioritized.

To share ideas for new or enhanced features, add them to our Github [Ideas Discussion](https://github.com/freelawproject/feature-foresight/discussions/categories/ideas). Those ideas may be added to the roadmap in the future.

FLP staff with well-defined feature requests can add them to the [Github Project board](https://github.com/orgs/freelawproject/projects/59/views/1). There will soon be an issue template that specifies what details to include. If you do not have enough information to fill in the template, we encourage you to share the feature in the Ideas Discussion.

Feature prioritization takes place on the Github Project board.
